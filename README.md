# Lunatic Rave 3
Lunatic Rave 3 is an open source and cross-platform alternative to the popular BMS player Lunatic Rave 2.

## why
Lunatic Rave 2, developed by lavalse, was last updated 8 years ago. The program is riddled with minor bugs, memory leaks related to most of its features, and an undisclosed security critcial bug allowing arbitrary code execution through a specially crafted BMS header file. Despite its abandonware status, Lunatic Rave 2 remains the most popular software for playing BMS. This project indends to fix all known bugs, retain all gameplay elements from LR2, and provide features for a better end user experience.

## features?
Features include, but are not limited to...

- full support for custom resolutions
- support for higher (and lower) monitor refresh rates
- multiple cpu core support (4+ psysical cores)
- support for bmson file format
- faster boot and loading times
- wide character support to remove need for changing system locale (option to enforce UTF-8 if you want for whatever reason)
- integrated bemusicseeker (GLAssist, but better)
- various bug fixes
